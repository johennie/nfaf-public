# Model_A AI-mediated rewrite (verbatim Chapter 1 - Modern English)
Here’s a modern English rewrite of the passage you shared. I’ve kept the meaning, tone, and flow faithful to the original, while simplifying the language and phrasing so it reads naturally for a present-day audience:

---

Emma Woodhouse was attractive, intelligent, and wealthy. With a comfortable home and cheerful nature, she seemed to have all of life’s best advantages, and at nearly twenty-one years old she had experienced very little trouble or unhappiness.

She was the younger of two daughters, dearly loved and spoiled by their affectionate father. After her sister’s marriage, Emma had taken charge of the household while still quite young. Her mother had died so long ago that Emma only vaguely remembered her, but her place had been filled by Miss Taylor, an excellent governess who had shown Emma almost motherly affection.

Miss Taylor had lived with the Woodhouses for sixteen years—less like a governess than a friend. She loved both daughters but had a special bond with Emma, more like sisters than teacher and pupil. Even before Miss Taylor officially stopped being her governess, her gentle nature had meant she rarely enforced rules. In recent years, they had simply lived together as equals: Emma free to do as she pleased, respecting Miss Taylor’s advice but mostly following her own judgment.

The only real disadvantages in Emma’s otherwise ideal situation were that she usually got her own way and tended to think a little too highly of herself. Still, she didn’t see these as problems.

Her first taste of sorrow came when Miss Taylor married Mr. Weston. Though the match promised happiness for her friend, Emma deeply felt the loss. On the day of the wedding, after the celebrations were over, Emma sat in sadness, thinking of all she would miss: Miss Taylor’s kindness and affection over sixteen years, her care during childhood illnesses, her companionship in recent years, and her constant, non-judgmental affection. Emma wondered how she would bear the change.

Although Mrs. Weston would live only half a mile away, Emma knew it would never be the same as having Miss Taylor in the house. Emma loved her father dearly, but he wasn’t a true companion—too old in habits and temperament, too anxious and fragile in health, and uninterested in lively conversation. Her sister Isabella lived in London, not far but not close enough for daily visits, so long autumn evenings at Hartfield stretched before her.

Highbury, the nearby village, offered Emma many acquaintances, but none equal to her in rank or intimacy. Everyone looked up to the Woodhouses, but there was no one who could replace Miss Taylor as a true friend.

Her father, meanwhile, was more distressed than Emma, for he disliked change of any kind. He thought Miss Taylor’s marriage as much a loss for her as for them, convinced she would have been happier staying at Hartfield forever. Emma, to keep up his spirits, tried to stay cheerful.

That evening, their close family friend Mr. Knightley arrived. Nearly forty, sensible and good-natured, he lived nearby and often visited. He brought news from Isabella and her family in London, which cheered Mr. Woodhouse. But when the conversation turned back to the wedding, Emma and Mr. Knightley good-naturedly debated whether Miss Taylor’s marriage was a sad loss or a happy success.

Emma, half teasing, proudly claimed credit for arranging the match, saying she had predicted it four years earlier. Mr. Knightley scolded her for boasting about a “lucky guess,” but Emma insisted that she had done more than guess—she had encouraged the connection in many small ways.

Mr. Woodhouse, meanwhile, begged her not to meddle in making any more matches. Emma promised she would not for herself—but hinted she might find a wife for young Mr. Elton, the village vicar. Her father thought inviting him to dinner would be a better kindness, and Mr. Knightley heartily agreed, laughing that a man in his late twenties could manage his own marriage.
