I'll rewrite this opening chapter of Jane Austen's "Emma" in modern English for you.

I've rewritten the opening chapter of Jane Austen's "Emma" in modern English. The translation preserves the plot, character relationships, and key dialogue while making the language more accessible to contemporary readers.

The main changes include:

Simplifying complex sentence structures
Updating archaic vocabulary and phrases
Converting formal 19th-century speech patterns to more natural modern dialogue
Clarifying references that might be unclear to modern readers
Maintaining the essential meaning and tone while making it much easier to follow
The story remains the same: Emma Woodhouse is dealing with the marriage of her beloved governess Miss Taylor to Mr. Weston, and we meet key characters like her father Mr. Woodhouse and family friend Mr. Knightley, while Emma already begins plotting her next matchmaking scheme with Mr. Elton.
---

Emma Woodhouse was beautiful, smart, and wealthy, with a comfortable home and a cheerful personality. She seemed to have all the best things life could offer, and had lived almost twenty-one years with very little to upset or trouble her.

She was the younger of two daughters with a very loving, indulgent father. After her sister got married, Emma had been running his household from a very young age. Her mother had died so long ago that Emma barely remembered her hugs and kisses. Her mother's role had been filled by an excellent governess who had loved her almost like a mother.

Miss Taylor had been with the Woodhouse family for sixteen years, more as a friend than a governess. She was very fond of both daughters, but especially Emma. Between them, it was more like the closeness of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had officially stopped being a governess, her gentle nature had barely allowed her to impose any rules. Now that her authority was long gone, they had been living together as close friends, with Emma doing whatever she wanted while highly respecting Miss Taylor's judgment, but mostly following her own ideas.

The real problems with Emma's situation were that she had too much freedom to do whatever she wanted, and she thought a little too highly of herself. These were the disadvantages that threatened to spoil her many pleasures. However, she was so unaware of this danger that she didn't consider these things problems at all.

Then sorrow came—a gentle sadness—but not in the form of any unpleasant self-awareness. Miss Taylor got married. Losing Miss Taylor was what first brought grief. It was on her beloved friend's wedding day that Emma first sat thinking sadly about what would continue. After the wedding was over and the wedding guests had gone, she and her father were left to eat dinner together, with no hope of a third person to cheer up a long evening. Her father settled down for his usual after-dinner nap, and she could only sit and think about what she had lost.

The marriage promised to bring happiness to her friend. Mr. Weston was a man of excellent character, comfortable wealth, appropriate age, and pleasant manners. There was some satisfaction in thinking about how unselfishly and generously she had always wanted and encouraged this match, but it was still a terrible day for her. She would miss Miss Taylor every hour of every day. She remembered all her past kindness—the kindness and love of sixteen years—how she had taught her and played with her since she was five years old—how she had devoted all her energy to entertaining and caring for her when she was healthy—and how she had nursed her through various childhood illnesses. She owed her a huge debt of gratitude. But the friendship of the last seven years, the equal relationship and complete openness that had developed after Isabella's marriage when they were left to each other, was an even more precious memory. She had been a friend and companion that few people had: intelligent, well-informed, helpful, gentle, knowing all the family's ways, interested in all their concerns, and especially interested in Emma herself—in every pleasure, every plan of hers. She was someone Emma could share every thought with as it came to her, and who loved her so much that she never found fault.

How was she going to handle this change? It was true that her friend was only moving half a mile away, but Emma knew there would be a huge difference between Mrs. Weston half a mile away and Miss Taylor living in the house. Despite all her natural and domestic advantages, she was now in serious danger of intellectual loneliness. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He couldn't keep up with her in conversation, whether serious or playful.

The problem of their age difference (Mr. Woodhouse hadn't married young) was made much worse by his personality and habits. Having been a hypochondriac all his life, without mental or physical activity, he seemed much older than his years. Though everyone loved him for his kind heart and pleasant temper, his abilities wouldn't have impressed anyone at any time.

Her sister, though not very far away since her marriage, living in London only sixteen miles away, was still beyond daily contact. Many long October and November evenings would have to be endured at Hartfield before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella, her husband, and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant company again.

Highbury, the large and busy village that was almost a town, to which Hartfield really belonged despite its separate lawn, gardens, and name, offered her no equals. The Woodhouses were the most important family there. Everyone looked up to them. She had many acquaintances in the area because her father was polite to everyone, but not one of them could replace Miss Taylor for even half a day. It was a depressing change, and Emma couldn't help but sigh about it and wish for impossible things, until her father woke up and she had to be cheerful. He needed emotional support. He was a nervous man, easily depressed, fond of everyone he was used to, and hating to part with them. He hated any kind of change. Marriage, as the cause of change, was always unpleasant to him. He still wasn't reconciled to his own daughter's marriage, and could never speak of her without pity, even though it had been completely a love match. Now he had to part with Miss Taylor too. Because of his habit of gentle selfishness and never being able to imagine that other people could feel differently than he did, he was very inclined to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been much happier if she had spent the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts, but when tea came, he couldn't help saying exactly what he had said at dinner:

"Poor Miss Taylor! I wish she were here again. What a shame that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"

"I can't agree with you, Papa. You know I can't. Mr. Weston is such a good-natured, pleasant, excellent man that he completely deserves a good wife. You wouldn't want Miss Taylor to live with us forever and put up with all my strange moods when she could have a house of her own, would you?"

"A house of her own! But what's the advantage of a house of her own? This one is three times as big. And you never have any strange moods, my dear."

"How often we'll be visiting them, and they'll be visiting us! We'll always be getting together! We should start—we need to go pay them a wedding visit very soon."

"My dear, how am I going to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I couldn't walk half that far."

"No, Papa, nobody expected you to walk. We'll have to take the carriage, of course."

"The carriage! But James won't like having to harness the horses for such a short trip—and where will the poor horses stay while we're making our visit?"

"They'll be put in Mr. Weston's stable, Papa. You know we've already settled all that. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night. And as for James, you can be sure he'll always like going to Randalls because his daughter works there as a housemaid. I only wonder if he'll ever want to take us anywhere else. That was your doing, Papa. You got Hannah that good job. Nobody thought of Hannah until you mentioned her—James is so grateful to you!"

"I'm very glad I thought of her. It was very fortunate, because I wouldn't want poor James to feel slighted for any reason. I'm sure she'll make a very good servant—she's a polite, well-spoken girl. I think very highly of her. Whenever I see her, she always curtsies and asks how I am in a very nice way. When you've had her here to do sewing, I notice she always turns the door lock the right way and never slams it. I'm sure she'll be an excellent servant, and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have someone around that she's used to seeing. Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, she'll be hearing about us. He'll be able to tell her how we're all doing."

Emma did everything she could to maintain this happier train of thought, and hoped that with the help of backgammon, she could get her father through the evening reasonably well while only dealing with her own regrets. The backgammon table was set up, but a visitor immediately walked in afterward, making the game unnecessary.

Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about thirty-seven or thirty-eight, was not only a very old and close friend of the family, but particularly connected to it as the older brother of Isabella's husband. He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor and always welcome—and at this time more welcome than usual since he was coming directly from their mutual connections in London. He had returned home for a late dinner after being away for several days, and now walked up to Hartfield to report that everyone was well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance that cheered Mr. Woodhouse for a while. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner that always did him good, and his many questions about "poor Isabella" and her children were answered very satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed, "It's very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to visit us. I'm afraid you must have had a terrible walk."

"Not at all, sir. It's a beautiful moonlit night, and so mild that I have to step back from your big fire."

"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I hope you don't catch cold."

"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them."

"Well! That's quite surprising, because we've had a lot of rain here. It rained terribly hard for half an hour while we were having breakfast. I wanted them to postpone the wedding."

"By the way—I haven't congratulated you yet. Being pretty well aware of what kind of joy you must both be feeling, I haven't been in a hurry with my congratulations. But I hope it all went reasonably well. How did you all behave? Who cried the most?"

"Ah! Poor Miss Taylor! It's a sad situation."

"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please, but I can't possibly say 'poor Miss Taylor.' I have great respect for you and Emma, but when it comes to the question of dependence versus independence! At any rate, it must be better to have only one person to please instead of two."

"Especially when one of those two is such a demanding, troublesome person!" said Emma playfully. "That's what you're thinking, I know—and what you would certainly say if my father weren't here."

"I believe that's very true, my dear," said Mr. Woodhouse with a sigh. "I'm afraid I'm sometimes very demanding and troublesome."

"My dearest Papa! You don't think I could mean you, or suppose Mr. Knightley means you. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I only meant myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—as a joke—it's all a joke. We always say whatever we want to each other."

Mr. Knightley was, in fact, one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her about them. Though this wasn't particularly pleasant for Emma herself, she knew it would be much less pleasant for her father, so she wouldn't want him to really suspect that not everyone thought she was perfect.

"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightley, "but I didn't mean to criticize anyone. Miss Taylor has been used to pleasing two people; now she'll only have to please one. The chances are that she'll benefit from this."

"Well," said Emma, willing to let it go, "you want to hear about the wedding, and I'll be happy to tell you, because we all behaved wonderfully. Everyone was on time, everyone looked their best—not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no, we all felt that we were only going to be half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day."

"Dear Emma handles everything so well," said her father. "But, Mr. Knightley, she's really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I'm sure she'll miss her more than she realizes."

Emma turned her head away, torn between tears and smiles. "It's impossible that Emma shouldn't miss such a companion," said Mr. Knightley. "We wouldn't think as highly of her as we do, sir, if we could imagine otherwise. But she knows how much this marriage benefits Miss Taylor; she knows how welcome it must be, at Miss Taylor's age, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important it is for her to be financially secure. Therefore she can't allow herself to feel as much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor's should be glad to see her so happily married."

"And you've forgotten one source of joy for me," said Emma, "and a very significant one—that I made the match myself. I made the match, you know, four years ago. To have it actually happen and be proven right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, should comfort me through anything."

Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, "Ah! My dear, I wish you wouldn't make matches and predict things, because whatever you say always comes true. Please don't make any more matches."

"I promise not to make any for myself, Papa, but I really must for other people. It's the most fun thing in the world! And after such success, you know! Everyone said that Mr. Weston would never marry again. Oh my, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower for so long and seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly busy either with his business in town or with his friends here, always welcome wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston wouldn't need to spend a single evening alone all year if he didn't want to. Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked about a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others about his son and uncle not allowing it. All kinds of serious nonsense was said on the subject, but I didn't believe any of it.

"Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met him in Broadway Lane, when it started to drizzle and he rushed away so gallantly and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match from that moment, and when I've had such success in this case, dear Papa, you can't expect me to give up matchmaking."

"I don't understand what you mean by 'success,'" said Mr. Knightley. "Success implies effort. Your time would have been properly and carefully spent if you had been working for the last four years to bring about this marriage. What a worthy occupation for a young lady! But if, as I rather suspect, your 'making the match,' as you call it, only means your planning it—saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it would be very good for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston married her,' and saying it to yourself every now and then afterward—why do you talk about success? Where's your achievement? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess, and that's all that can be said."

"And have you never experienced the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess? I feel sorry for you. I thought you were smarter—because, believe me, a lucky guess is never just luck. There's always some skill involved. And as for my poor word 'success,' which you're criticizing, I don't think I'm completely without any claim to it. You've painted two pretty pictures, but I think there might be a third—something between doing nothing and doing everything. If I hadn't encouraged Mr. Weston's visits here, given many little bits of encouragement, and smoothed over many little problems, it might not have worked out at all. I think you know Hartfield well enough to understand that."

"A straightforward, honest man like Weston and a sensible, genuine woman like Miss Taylor can safely be left to handle their own affairs. You're more likely to have hurt yourself than helped them by interfering."

"Emma never thinks of herself if she can help others," added Mr. Woodhouse, understanding only part of the conversation. "But, my dear, please don't make any more matches. They're silly things and break up one's family circle terribly."

"Just one more, Papa—only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr. Elton, Papa. I need to find a wife for him. There's nobody in Highbury who deserves him, and he's been here a whole year and has made his house so comfortable that it would be a shame for him to stay single any longer. I thought when he was performing the wedding ceremony today, he looked very much like he'd like to have the same service done for him! I think very highly of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I can do him a favor."

"Mr. Elton is a very handsome young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I think highly of him. But if you want to show him attention, my dear, ask him to come have dinner with us sometime. That would be much better. I'm sure Mr. Knightley would be kind enough to join him."

"With great pleasure, sir, anytime," said Mr. Knightley, laughing. "And I completely agree that it would be much better. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best fish and chicken, but let him choose his own wife. Trust me, a man of twenty-six or twenty-seven can take care of himself."
