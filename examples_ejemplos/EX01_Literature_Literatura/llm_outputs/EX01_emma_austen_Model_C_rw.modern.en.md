Emma Woodhouse, who was a handsome, clever, and wealthy woman with a pleasant home and a happy attitude, seemed to have been blessed with all the best things in life. She had lived for almost 21 years with very little to worry or bother her.

She was the youngest of two daughters born to a loving, lenient father. After her sister got married, Emma took over as the lady of the house at a very young age. Her mother had died too long ago for Emma to remember much of her affection, and her role had been filled by a wonderful governess who was as loving as a mother.

Miss Taylor had been with the Woodhouse family for 16 years, more as a friend than a governess. She was very fond of both daughters, but especially Emma. They were as close as sisters. Even before Miss Taylor officially stopped being the governess, her gentle nature meant she rarely imposed any rules. Now that her authority was a thing of the past, they were living together as mutually devoted friends. Emma did as she pleased, respecting Miss Taylor's judgment but mostly following her own.

The real downsides of Emma's situation were that she had too much freedom and tended to think a little too highly of herself. These were the flaws that threatened to spoil her many joys. However, the danger was so unnoticed at the time that she didn't see them as problems at all.

Then, a gentle sadness came—but not in the form of any uncomfortable self-realization. Miss Taylor got married. The loss of Miss Taylor was what first brought grief to Emma. It was on the wedding day of her beloved friend that Emma first sat in continuous mournful thought. After the wedding was over and the wedding guests were gone, she and her father were left to dine alone, with no one to cheer them up during a long evening. Her father fell asleep after dinner as usual, and Emma was left to just sit and think about what she had lost.

The marriage promised every happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a man of good character, with a comfortable income, a suitable age, and pleasant manners. There was some comfort in thinking how she had unselfishly and generously wished for and encouraged the match. But for Emma, it was a sad occasion. She would feel the absence of Miss Taylor every hour of every day. She remembered Miss Taylor's past kindness—the kindness and affection of 16 years—how she had taught and played with her since she was five years old, how she had devoted herself to entertaining and cheering her up when she was well, and how she had nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. Emma owed her a great deal of gratitude. But the relationship of the last seven years—the equal footing and perfect openness that had developed after Isabella's marriage, when they were left to each other—was an even dearer, more tender memory. She had been a friend and companion few people ever have: smart, well-informed, helpful, and gentle. She knew all the family's habits, was interested in all their concerns, and was especially interested in Emma herself—in her every pleasure and plan. She was someone Emma could share every thought with as it came to her and who loved her so much that she could never find fault.

How was she going to handle this change? It was true that her friend was only moving half a mile away. But Emma knew there would be a huge difference between having Mrs. Weston half a mile away and having Miss Taylor in the house. Despite all her natural and domestic advantages, Emma was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual loneliness. She loved her father dearly, but he was not a companion for her. He couldn't keep up with her in conversation, whether it was serious or playful.

The problem of the significant age gap between them (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was made worse by his health and habits. He had been an invalid his whole life, with no mental or physical energy, so he was much older in his ways than in his years. Though everyone loved him for his kind heart and gentle nature, his intelligence wouldn't have impressed anyone at any point in his life.

Her sister, though not far away geographically since she was settled in London, only 16 miles away, was still too far for a daily visit. Emma would have to get through many long October and November evenings at Hartfield before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella, her husband, and their young children to fill the house and give her pleasant company again.

Highbury, the large and busy village that was almost a town, and to which Hartfield really belonged despite its separate lawn, gardens, and name, had no equals for Emma. The Woodhouses were the most important family there. Everyone looked up to them. She had many acquaintances in the village, as her father was polite to everyone, but there wasn't one person who could take Miss Taylor's place for even half a day. It was a sad change, and Emma couldn't help sighing over it and wishing for impossible things until her father woke up and she had to be cheerful. His mood needed support. He was a sensitive man, easily made sad. He was fond of everyone he was used to and hated to part with them. He hated change of any kind. Marriage, as a cause of change, was always unpleasant to him, and he still wasn't reconciled to his own daughter's marriage. He could never speak of her without pity, even though it was a marriage of love. And now he was forced to part with Miss Taylor, too. Because of his gentle selfishness and his inability to imagine that other people could feel differently than he did, he was very inclined to think Miss Taylor had done something as sad for herself as she had for them and would have been much happier if she had spent the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to distract him from such thoughts. But when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly what he had said at dinner:

"Poor Miss Taylor! I wish she were here again. What a shame that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"

"I can't agree with you, Papa; you know I can't. Mr. Weston is such a good-natured, pleasant, excellent man that he completely deserves a good wife. And you wouldn't have wanted Miss Taylor to live with us forever and put up with all my weird moods when she could have a house of her own?"

"A house of her own! But what's the benefit of a house of her own? This one is three times as big. And you never have any weird moods, my dear."

"We'll be going to see them so often, and they'll be coming to see us! We'll be always meeting! We must start. We have to go and pay a wedding visit very soon."

"My dear, how am I to get that far? Randalls is such a distance. I couldn't walk half that far."

"No, Papa, no one thought of you walking. We must go in the carriage, of course."

"The carriage! But James won't like to get the horses ready for such a short trip. And where will the poor horses be while we're visiting?"

"They'll be put in Mr. Weston's stable, Papa. You know we've already figured all that out. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night. And as for James, you can be sure he'll always like going to Randalls because his daughter is the housemaid there. I only wonder if he'll ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing, Papa. You got Hannah that good job. No one thought of Hannah until you mentioned her. James is so grateful to you!"

"I am very glad I did think of her. It was very fortunate, because I wouldn't have wanted poor James to feel ignored for anything. And I'm sure she'll be a very good servant. She's a polite, well-spoken girl. I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always curtsies and asks how I am in a very nice way. And when you've had her here to do needlework, I notice she always turns the doorknob the right way and never bangs the door. I'm sure she'll be an excellent servant, and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have someone around her that she is used to seeing. Whenever James goes to see his daughter, you know, she'll be hearing from us. He'll be able to tell her how we all are."

Emma did her best to keep this happier conversation going, and she hoped that with the help of a game of backgammon, she could get her father through the evening without any regrets but her own. The backgammon table was set up, but a visitor arrived immediately after, making it unnecessary.

Mr. Knightley, a sensible man of about 37 or 38, was not only a very old and close friend of the family but was also especially connected to them as the older brother of Isabella's husband. He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent and always welcome visitor, and at this moment, he was more welcome than usual because he had just come from their shared relatives in London. He had returned to a late dinner after being away for several days and had now walked to Hartfield to say that everyone in Brunswick Square was doing well. It was a happy event and cheered up Mr. Woodhouse for a while. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner that always did him good, and his many questions about "poor Isabella" and her children were answered very satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse said gratefully, "It's very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to visit us. I'm afraid you must have had a dreadful walk."

"Not at all, sir. It's a beautiful moonlight night, and so mild that I have to move back from your big fire."

"But you must have found it very damp and muddy. I hope you don't catch a cold."

"Muddy, sir? Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them."

"Well! That's quite surprising, because we've had a great deal of rain here. It rained terribly hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I wanted them to postpone the wedding."

"By the way—I haven't congratulated you. Knowing pretty well what kind of joy you must both be feeling, I haven't been in a hurry with my congratulations. But I hope it all went off reasonably well. How did you all behave? Who cried the most?"

"Ah! Poor Miss Taylor! It's a sad business."

"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please. But I can't possibly say 'poor Miss Taylor.' I have great affection for you and Emma, but when it comes to the question of being dependent or independent! In any case, it must be better to have only one person to please than two."

"Especially when one of those two is such a fussy, troublesome creature!" said Emma playfully. "That's what you're thinking, I know—and what you'd definitely say if my father weren't here."

"I believe it's very true, my dear, indeed," said Mr. Woodhouse, with a sigh. "I'm afraid I am sometimes very fussy and troublesome."

"My dearest Papa! You don't think I could have meant you, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean you. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I only meant myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—as a joke—it's all a joke. We always say what we want to each other."

Mr. Knightley was, in fact, one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her about them. And while this wasn't particularly pleasant for Emma, she knew it would be so much less so for her father that she wouldn't have him really suspect that she wasn't considered perfect by everyone.

"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightley, "but I didn't mean any criticism of anyone. Miss Taylor has been used to pleasing two people; she will now have only one. The chances are that she must benefit from it."

"Well," said Emma, willing to let it go, "you want to hear about the wedding. And I'll be happy to tell you, because we all behaved wonderfully. Everyone was on time, everyone looked their best. Not a tear, and hardly a sad face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we were only going to be half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day."

"Dear Emma handles everything so well," said her father. "But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I'm sure she will miss her more than she thinks."

Emma turned her head away, torn between tears and smiles. "It's impossible that Emma shouldn't miss such a companion," said Mr. Knightley. "We wouldn't like her as much as we do, sir, if we could imagine it. But she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's advantage. She knows how very welcome it must be, at Miss Taylor's age, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important it is for her to be secure of a comfortable living. And therefore, she can't allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married."

"And you've forgotten one thing that brings me joy," said Emma, "and a very significant one—that I made the match myself. I made the match, you know, four years ago. And to have it happen, and to be proven right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, can comfort me for anything."

Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father replied fondly, "Ah! My dear, I wish you wouldn't make matches and predict things, because whatever you say always comes true. Please don't make any more matches."

"I promise you I won't make any for myself, Papa. But I must, indeed, for other people. It's the most entertaining thing in the world! And after such a success, you know! Everyone said that Mr. Weston would never marry again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower for so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly busy either with his business in town or among his friends here, always welcomed wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston didn't need to spend a single evening of the year alone if he didn't want to. Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked about a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others about the son and the uncle not letting him. All sorts of serious nonsense was talked about the subject, but I believed none of it.

"Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met him in Broadway Lane, when, because it started to drizzle, he rushed away with so much charm and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind about the subject. I planned the match from that hour. And when such success has blessed me in this case, dear Papa, you can't think that I'll stop matchmaking."

"I don't understand what you mean by 'success,'" said Mr. Knightley. "Success implies effort. Your time has been spent properly and delicately if you have been trying for the last four years to make this marriage happen. A worthy pastime for a young lady! But if, which I imagine is more likely, your 'making the match' as you call it, only means your planning it—your saying to yourself one lazy day, 'I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess, and that is all that can be said."

"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess? I pity you. I thought you were cleverer—because, you can be sure, a lucky guess is never just luck. There is always some talent in it. And as for my poor word 'success,' which you are arguing with, I don't know that I am entirely without any claim to it. You have painted two pretty pictures. But I think there may be a third—a something in between doing nothing and doing it all. If I hadn't encouraged Mr. Weston's visits here and given many small encouragements and smoothed over many small matters, it might not have happened after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough to understand that."

"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a sensible, natural woman like Miss Taylor, can be safely left to manage their own affairs. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interfering."

"Emma never thinks of herself if she can do good for others," Mr. Woodhouse replied, only partially understanding. "But, my dear, please don't make any more matches. They are silly things and break up one's family circle terribly."

"Only one more, Papa. Only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr. Elton, Papa—I must look for a wife for him. There is no one in Highbury who deserves him—and he has been here for a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame for him to be single any longer. And I thought when he was joining their hands today, he looked so much as if he would like to have the same thing done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing him a service."

"Mr. Elton is a very nice young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to show him any attention, my dear, ask him to come and have dinner with us someday. That will be a much better thing. I'm sure Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him."

"With great pleasure, sir, at any time," said Mr. Knightley, laughing, "and I completely agree with you that it will be a much better thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to choose his own wife. You can be sure that a man of 26 or 27 can take care of himself."
