Thank you for the fourth article. Here's the paragraph summary:

**Article 4 Summary (Reuters):** The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a split decision to allow the "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention center in Florida to resume operations, blocking a lower court order that had halted new detainee intake and construction work. The facility, which cost $250 million to build and covers over 18 acres at a former airport site 37 miles west of Miami, is strategically located in subtropical wetlands surrounded by Big Cypress National Preserve and Everglades National Park, where alligators, crocodiles, and pythons create imagery the White House has leveraged to demonstrate immigration enforcement determination. The appeals court's majority opinion sided with the Trump administration against environmental groups Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, ruling that since Florida funded the project without federal construction funds, it didn't require federal environmental review despite promises from Governor DeSantis and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem that the federal government would pay for expansion. Trump, who toured the facility and called it a template for nationwide implementation, described it as housing "some of the most menacing migrantsâ€”some of the most vicious people on the planet," while the facility has detained 900 migrants so far and could potentially house thousands, making it central to his aggressive immigration enforcement agenda that has defined his political platform for a decade.

Reuters provides the most comprehensive details about capacity (thousands potential, 900 current) and Trump's specific quotes.
