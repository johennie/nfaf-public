Thank you for the third article. Here's the paragraph summary:

**Article 3 Summary (The Guardian):** An appellate panel voted 2-1 to put on hold a federal judge's order to close the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades within 60 days, allowing the controversial facility to continue operations while appeals are pending. The facility, which cost approximately $250 million to build and covers over 18 acres in the subtropical wetlands 37 miles west of Miami, was hastily constructed by Ron DeSantis's administration in late June to support Donald Trump's deportation efforts, with its remote swampy location deliberately chosen as an escape deterrent. The detention center has faced widespread criticism for harsh conditions, alleged abuse of detainees, denial of due process, and environmental damage to the fragile Everglades ecosystem that's home to alligators, crocodiles, pythons, rare birds, and manatees. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump administration would likely prevail against environmental groups' legal challenge, determining that since Florida funded the project itself while seeking federal reimbursement later, it didn't trigger the environmental review requirements that apply to federally funded construction projects, despite both DeSantis and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stating the federal government would pay for facility expansion.

The coverage is consistent across sources but The Guardian provides more detail about the facility's cost, size, and the harsh conditions allegations. Please share the fourth article!
