Thank you for the fifth article. Here's the paragraph summary:

**Article 5 Summary (AP News):** A federal appeals court panel in Atlanta voted 2-1 to stay a lower court judge's order that would have ended operations at the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades by the end of October, allowing the facility to continue holding detainees while the appeal process unfolds. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams had issued a preliminary injunction requiring the facility to wind down operations, transfer detainees elsewhere, and remove equipment and fencing following a lawsuit by Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argued that state and federal officials violated environmental review requirements for construction in sensitive wetlands. The facility was rapidly constructed by Governor Ron DeSantis's administration in late June on an isolated airstrip to support President Trump's deportation efforts, with its remote Everglades location deliberately chosen as an escape deterrent similar to the California island prison it was named after. The appeals court majority accepted arguments from state and federal defendants that environmental impact requirements don't apply since the federal government hasn't spent money to build or operate the facility despite Florida seeking federal grant funding, while Trump, who toured the facility in July and suggested it as a nationwide model, and DeSantis celebrated the ruling as keeping the detention center "open for business" against what DHS characterized as attempts by "open-borders activists" to hinder law enforcement.

AP provides some unique details about the specific timeline (end of October deadline) and the legal nuances about federal vs state funding. Please share the sixth and final article!
