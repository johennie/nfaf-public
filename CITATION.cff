abstract: >
  NFAF is a framework for detecting when AI translations, summaries, or rewrites
  flatten distinctive voicesâ€”helping stakeholders see when outputs sound more uniform
  than their sources. It specifies qualitative indicators and quantitative flags,
  a seven-stage workflow, and example applications (literature, journalism, law).
  NFAF is non-prescriptive: it separates detection from judgment and can be adapted
  beyond Western scholarly traditions.
