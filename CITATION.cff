The Narrative Flattening Analysis Framework (NFAF) provides a structured method to detect and
  classify narrative flattening in AI-mediated transformations such as translation, summarization,
  and rewriting. Version 0.5.0 formalizes the rubric dimensions and seven-stage workflow, expands
  illustrative applications across literature, journalism, and law, and introduces systematic
  treatment of structural, semantic, cultural, and jurisdictional flattening. This release also
  clarifies diagnostic vs. evidential use, and explicitly notes the frameworkâ€™s cultural scope and
  limitations, inviting extension beyond Western scholarly traditions.
