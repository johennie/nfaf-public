  The Narrative Flattening Analysis Framework (NFAF) formalizes definitions of narrative, 
  flattening, and narrative flattening, along with supporting concepts such as algorithmic/centroid English, semantic drift, 
  alignment, and signal preservation. This release establishes the theoretical foundations, introduces the centroid pivot concept, and demonstrates its application through a worked literary rewrite example (Austenâ€™s Emma), alongside expanded definitions, rubrics, and references.
