Changelog v0.3.0 (2025-09-06)

Consolidates NFAFâ€™s definitional base, adds the centroid english concept.

Introduces expanded categories for semantic drift, cadence, and flattening.

Establishes clear roadmap toward worked examples in v0.4.x.

Key Updates

Flattening: clarified as manifesting in multiple directions (erosion, inflation, addition/inference).

Addition/Inference: defined as model-driven insertion of absent details, often drawn from training familiarity (e.g., canonical texts, legal precedents).

Semantic Drift: expanded into lexical, syntactic, and pragmatic subtypes.

Voice Cadence Metrics: introduced as quantitative measures for stylistic rhythm (sentence variance, figurative density, punctuation rhythm, prosodic markers).

Flattening Indicators: broadened with over-specificity, canonical pull, domain transfer, and back-translation mismatch.

Scope: updated to reference future v0.4.x focus on worked examples.

Changelog v0.2.0 (2025-08-16)

Added formal definitions of narrative, flattening, narrative flattening, semantic drift, alignment, and signal preservation.

Introduced a high-level rubric with five dimensions (lexical richness, rhythm & cadence, figurative density, cultural register, emotional intensity).

Expanded rubric table to include core signals and notes for each dimension.

Clarified that the rubric is defined at the conceptual level only; future minor releases (v0.2.x) may introduce provisional categorical scoring (e.g., low / medium / high).

Updated scope: framework, definitions, and rubric are included; examples and refinements are marked as work in progress.
