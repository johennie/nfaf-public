## Abstract
**The Narrative Flattening Analysis Framework (NFAF)** is a methodology for detecting and analyzing the loss or convergence of distinct cultural, emotional, and stylistic features in narratives as they pass through automated processes such as machine translation, summarization, rewriting, or other AI-mediated transformations.

Narrative is defined here in its broadest sense. NFAF is adaptable to a wide range of use cases and modalities. It outlines modular stages for alignment, semantic drift detection, and qualitative-quantitative analysis, enabling reviewers to identify meaning loss or homogenization including subtle or accumulative cultural, political, or semantic transformation. Designed to balance rigor with flexibility, NFAF provides a replicable structure for future research while remaining open to domain-specific refinement.

**Current focus:** Applying NFAF to *narrative voice in literary text*, with emphasis on preserving cultural and emotional signals in AI-mediated transformation.

## High-Level Process
1. **Input Selection**  
   Identify source narratives and define intended transformations (e.g., translation, summarization, rewriting).  

2. **Transformation**  
   Apply automated or AI-mediated processes to generate alternate versions.  

3. **Alignment**  
   Match source and transformed segments for side-by-side comparative analysis.  

4. **Semantic Drift Assessment**  
   Examine differences in meaning, tone, and cultural/emotional signals.  

5. **Pattern Analysis**  
   Record recurring changes or flattening patterns across transformations.  

6. **Human-in-the-Loop Review (optional)**  
   Validate findings through targeted human evaluation.  

7. **Reporting**  
   Summarize observed patterns and potential contributing factors.
